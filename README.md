# ChillMuriNFT 🎨

Welcome to **ChillMuriNFT**, my first ERC721 NFT collection! 🚀 This project is a hands-on exploration of smart contract development, decentralized storage, and NFT marketplace integration. The collection is deployed on the **Sepolia testnet** and includes **4 rarity levels**, with a special **Legendary NFT** yet to be minted.

## 📜 Overview  

ChillMuriNFT is an ERC721 NFT collection built with **OpenZeppelin**, integrated with **Pinata** and **IPFS** for decentralized metadata and asset storage. The project also incorporates advanced features like rarity levels, whitelisting, and a public minting list.  

The NFTs are listed on **OpenSea’s Sepolia testnet**, and a DApp is under development to allow free minting using test ETH from a faucet.
